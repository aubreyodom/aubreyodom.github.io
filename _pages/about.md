I am an incoming T32 Postdoctoral Researcher at the Boston University. I will be working on methods for longitudinal integrative “-omics” analysis of TOPMed data, and predictive biomarkers of heightened atrial fibrillation. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at Boston University.

Outside of the lab, my favorite hobbies include [photography](https://aubreyodom.com), compiling the various historical background music loops used at Disneyland, attending indie rock concerts, and visiting vintage shops around Boston.
